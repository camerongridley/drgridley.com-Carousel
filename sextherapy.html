          <h2>What is sex therapy?</h2>
          <p>Sexual difficulties are very common among partners of all genders. Unfortunately, many factors often lead people to feel too embarrassed or ashamed to ask about available treatments. This leads to everyone thinking are the only ones having trouble and that simply isn't true! I will work with you, at your pace, to help you overcome your obstacles and achieve a new comfort and excitement for sex. Sex therapy can help you realize that you are not alone in your struggle and that there are many effective treatments available to allow you to reach their full sexual potential. It all starts with the courage to begin talking about what you want!</p>

          <h2>What problems can it help with?</h2>
          <p>I provide sex therapy to help with many such difficulties, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Low sexual desire</li>
                <li>Difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm</li>
                <li>Premature ejaculation</li>
                <li>Erectile dysfunction</li>
                <li>Pain during intercourse</li>
            </ul></p>

          <h2>What happens in the sessions?</h2>
          <p>Sex therapy can look different for each individual and couple. There are many elements that are similar to therapy for general psychological concerns. Some of what is different is that sex therapy is focused on talking clearly, openly, and directly about sex in a safe and structured way. We start by discussing the difficulties you are experiencing in plain and straightforward terms. The first important step is de-stigmatizing what is happening for you, so you can learn to talk about it without shame and embarrassment. Virtually every adult experiences problems with sex, be it with erectile difficulty, premature ejaculation, low sexual desire, or difficulty achieving orgasm, so there is no reason to feel alone. During this time we also establish any patterns or cycles in your relationship that may be reinforcing the problem. Next I provide you with structured, evidence-based, exercises for you to do at home that specifically target your goal. These exercises help uncover any other patterns that are getting in your way and allow you to master new skills, increasing you sense of empowerment and confidence in your sex life.
